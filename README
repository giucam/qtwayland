This is the QtWayland module.

The QtWayland module consists of two main parts:

Wayland platform plugin:
    Enables Qt applications to be run as Wayland clients.

QtCompositor API:
    Enables the creation of Wayland compositors using Qt and QtQuick.

By default only the Wayland platform plugin is built.  If you want to build the
experimental QtCompositor API then you need to set the qmake BUILD_MODULES variable to
include "wayland-compositor" when building the QtWayland module:

qmake BUILD_MODULES+=wayland_compositor
make

Other than wayland_compositor there are other submodules which are built by default.
You can however remove them with "BUILD_MODULES-=module" or you can just set the BUILD_MODULES
variable to the modules you want. The available modules are:

qtwaylandscanner
wayland_compositor
wayland_client
wayland_generic_plugin
wayland_egl_plugin
drm_egl_server_plugin
libhybris_egl_server_plugin
xcomposite-glx_plugin
xcomposite-egl_plugin
brcm_egl_plugin


To build the QtWayland module you need the external dependencies:
xkbcommon 0.2.0 - http://xkbcommon.org/
wayland 1.1.0 - http://wayland.freedesktop.org/


We hang out at #qt-labs and #qt-lighthouse on freenode if you have any questions
